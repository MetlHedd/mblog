It was a dog. It was a big dog. My anger outweights my guilt. I'm Batman

I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

I'm Batman Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
