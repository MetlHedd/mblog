Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.

I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.
